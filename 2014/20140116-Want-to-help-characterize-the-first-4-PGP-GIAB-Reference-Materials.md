Want to help characterize the first 4 PGP GIAB Reference Materials?

Several of you helped us to characterize the pilot candidate NIST Reference Material based on NA12878, and that data has started to be uploaded to our ftp site. We're starting to learn a lot of interesting things from this informal interlaboratory study about variability within and between labs and instruments. We are now asking for volunteers to characterize the next set of 4 candidate NIST Reference Materials from the Personal Genome Project. We are excited about these genomes because they are consented broadly for many types of commercial applications, including redistribution of commercial Reference Materials based on the NIST Reference Materials (e.g., as part of a validation kit, in FFPE, engineered with mutations, as a negative control, etc.).

Over the next few weeks, Coriell will be sending us DNA from large batches of 4 cell lines from the Personal Genome Project, which we plan to make into NIST Reference Materials. These 4 cell lines include an Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish father-mother-son trio (PGP IDs: huAA53E0/hu8E87A9/hu6E4515; Coriell IDs: GM24143/GM24149/GM24385), and only the son in a Chinese trio (PGP IDs: hu91BD69/hu38168C/huCA017E; Coriell IDs: GM24695, GM24694, GM24631; and GM24631 is the son we have ordered).

We are looking for volunteers to help us characterize the DNA from the 4 large batches of cells that we plan to make into NIST Reference Materials. If you are interested, you will need to sign an MTA with NIST, and we can send this to you now in advance of receiving the DNA. Please respond to this email or email Justin Zook at NIST if you would like to receive the MTA. Even if you signed the MTA with us for the pilot Reference Material, you will still need to sign this one again. Also, for planning measurements at our workshop Jan 27-28, it would be great if you could let me know before then whether you think you might want to characterize these DNA, and if so, which measurements you might perform.

Thank you!

Justin Zook
