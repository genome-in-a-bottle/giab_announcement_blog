Post date: Tuesday, November 18, 2014 - 13:36 



We have scheduled a call about strategy for writing papers at 2pm EDT on Friday October 3. The call-in number will be (559) 726-1300; Passcode 135879#. To start the discussion, I've created short outlines of several papers that I've either discussed with others or started to write. We will discuss whether and how to combine these and other ideas, and how to prioritize them:
