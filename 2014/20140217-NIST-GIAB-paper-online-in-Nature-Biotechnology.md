Post date: Monday, February 17, 2014 - 00:00 



We are happy to announce that our paper "Integrating human sequence data sets provides a resource of benchmark SNP and indel genotype calls" is now published online in Nature Biotechnology at http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nbt.2835.html. For those of you using our NIST-GIAB high-confidence benchmark calls, we ask that you cite this manuscript rather than (or in addition to) our arXiv pre-print of this manuscript.

 

Also, it was great seeing many of you at AGBT, and for those of you who couldn't attend, our NIST posters are on slideshare at http://www.slideshare.net/GenomeInABottle/2014-agbt-giabprogress-update and http://www.slideshare.net/GenomeInABottle/2014-agbt-giab-data-integratio...
