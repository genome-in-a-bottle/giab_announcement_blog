Are you using our high-confidence calls?

Post date: Tuesday, November 18, 2014 - 06:51 

For our upcoming GIAB workshop, we'd like to collect some examples of how people are using our high-confidence calls for NA12878. If you'd be willing to share a slide or two, either we or you may present it at our workshop. If you're interested, please email Justin Zook at NIST. Even if you just have a moment to write a couple sentences about how you're using them, it would be very helpful to let us know.
