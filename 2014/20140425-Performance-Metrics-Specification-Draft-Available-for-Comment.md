Performance Metrics Specification Draft Available for Comment

Post date: Friday, April 25, 2014 - 19:39 



In the January Genome in a Bottle workshop, the Performance Metrics Working Group decided to develop a specification for a “user interface” for the NIST whole genome Reference Materials. This specification is intended to standardize how performance metrics are calculated when a user compares their characterization of the Reference Materials to the benchmark genotypes developed by GIAB. Deanna Church and Melissa Landrum have led the effort to develop this specification with input from others in GIAB, and we have now posted this specification on Google Docs for comments - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8Q-6aunFmyyeS_L3xmRMqUT8PmWdIiCrzdE.... We are asking that potential developers of performance metrics user interfaces and potential users of the Reference Materials review this document over the next couple weeks and add comments with suggestions or questions. If anyone is interested in helping to develop a performance metrics user interface, please let us know and we will be happy to talk with you.

Cheers,

Justin Zook
