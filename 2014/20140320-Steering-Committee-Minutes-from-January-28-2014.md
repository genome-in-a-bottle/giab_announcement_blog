Topics:

1. Composition of Steering Committee

MS had put out a call on the GIAB website for nominations or self-nominations for the Steering Committee. Those present were so selected.
MS suggested that Steering Committee meetings be “open door” and that the committee should work by consensus. Those present concurred.
There was a discussion of others who would be valuable additions if possible:
- FDA (Liz Mansfield or alternate) was unable to attend this Steering Committee meeting
- CAP (Karl Voelkerding or Nazneen Aziz were suggested)
- International representatives (other than Leming) – perhaps someone involved in EuroGenTest and/or the EU proficiency testing exercises
- A representative of an academic (rather than commercial) Dx lab could be valuable. Heidi Rehm or Birgit Funke of Harvard’s LMM, or Maduri Hedge of Emory were suggested. They however tend to be very busy.
- Action Item: MS will reach out

2. Scope of the GIAB, particularly which samples and activities to include

There was a long discussion of the appropriateness of including commercial reference materials (RMs), such as those from Horizon and Acrometrix. Constructs made by Mickey Williams of NCI were also discussed briefly. Also discussed was including activities such as the phase 2 of ABRFs proposed interlab sequencing study in the GIAB, which includes mixtures of DNA (phase 1 of the study is directly characterizing the Ashkenazim trio, so it clearly fits under GIAB).

General Conclusions:

a. While there was enthusiasm for the proposed ABRF study, it was felt that efforts formally within the GIAB consortium should focus on improving various RMs themselves. That said, the consortium members could and should collaborate closely with end-users in applying RMs for various purposes. It was particularly clear that studies like the ABRF’s could significantly help improve both RMs (in this particular case, the PGP sample to be used in conjunction with the commercial samples) and the tools for their use.
b. There was no particular need for the consortium to endorse the commercial RMs, any sequencing technology, or the ABRF study in order to accomplish this.
c. The Steering Committee was generally most enthusiastic about characterizing widely available inexpensive RMs which come without significant restrictions for most uses, such as NA12878, the PGP samples or (possibly) the ATCC tumor/normal cell lines. This did not need to be limited to NIST RMs, although some present were concerned about diluting efforts from the already-considerable task of characterizing the current and forthcoming NIST RMs. Future GIAB efforts to potentially characterize a commercial RM were not entirely ruled out, and the manufacturing and QC capability of the commercial vendors was noted as a potential future asset.
d. A number of members expressed that at the next GIAB meeting it may be valuable to have a longer session on applications of RMs, such as the ABRF study and others.
e. In the future, it was proposed that GIAB may organize a “jamboree” of people using the RMs to learn from each other.

3. Cancer and other RMs

There was an open question about (a) the priority of a cancer RM and (b) the “best” type of RM for somatic calling applications. This was generally viewed as important and cell lines from one (or more) matched tumor-normal pairs were generally viewed as “best” if possible. Various avenues will be investigated:
- It may be possible to make a cell-line from the PGP Ashkenazim trio father’s frozen colon cancer resection, giving a tumor normal cell line within a family to improve calls in the normal. Generally, this was thought to be highly valuable if possible.
- In the main GIAB meeting, the ex-Complete Genomics team (Geoff Nilsen, Steve Lincoln and Srinka Ghosh) had noted that the ATCC Breast cancer cell lines HCC1187 (with matched normal HCC1187-BL) and HCC2218 (with matched normal CRL2363) had served as a good model system at CG. 120x WGS from CG is already publicly available on these, and LKe thought that Broad and others may have released Illumina sequence. LKe will look into the consent of these and other possibilities at ATCC.
- Other avenues including use of engineered cell lines or spike-ins are possible. Mixtures of unrelated cell lines are possible and have been used, but are not ideal.
MS noted that the FDA may sponsor a study with NIST to validate the use of DNA or cells stabbed into FFPE as a model system for clinical FFPE specimens.

4. PR and Outreach

Many ideas were discussed. JZ et al.’s paper will be online Feb 16 making some of this timely. Assigned individuals are noted:
- NIST is likely doing a press release
- NIST is developing a 1-page flyer for GIAB, but current version is NIST-focused
- DB is organizing an NGS QC session at the ABRF conference and a GIAB “plug” could be done
- Nature may be interested into an editorial [JZ/MS]
- MS is giving a talk at AMP in November
- VP is an associate editor of JMD (the AMP Journal) and may contact others about a news piece
- CM and DC could contact various bloggers
- SL will talk with the Invitae PR folk for ideas

5. Meeting Adjourned.
