Agenda for August 2014 GIAB Workshop

Post date: Tuesday, November 18, 2014 - 06:54 



We are looking forward to seeing many of you at the GIAB workshop in two
weeks, August 14-15, 2014.  We have now posted a draft of the agenda for the
workshop at
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S1h2FVnQKGf-Egyfx6IaUnrWLil1YXoWYADenpc-7vs/edit?usp=sharing.
    At this workshop, we plan to present the Consortium's progress since the
last meeting, and outline and receive feedback about our product development
plans for the NIST whole genome Reference Materials, including the pilot
genome (based on NA12878) and the Ashkenazim and Asian trios from the
Personal Genomes Project.  We will outline our planned schedule for release
of DNA as NIST Reference Materials and the accompanying high-confidence SNP,
indel, structural variant, and homozygous reference calls.  We will also
discuss options for future NIST RMs. Below is information about registration
and travel to the workshop.

The workshop will be held at NIST (100 Bureau Dr, Gaithersburg, MD) on August
14-15, 2014. This will be a public workshop open to anyone interested in
participating in the Genome in a Bottle work. An agenda will be sent out
later, but our current plan for times is 9am to 5:30pm on August 14 and 9am
to 12:45pm on August 15, followed by a steering committee meeting from 1pm to
2:30pm. Travel information is available here:
