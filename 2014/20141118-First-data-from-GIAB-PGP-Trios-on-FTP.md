First data from GIAB PGP Trios on FTP

Post date: Tuesday, November 18, 2014 - 13:34 



The first data from the Personal Genome Project (PGP) trios that we plan to
make into NIST Reference Materials is now on the GIAB ftp site.  Complete
Genomics has sequenced both the Ashkenazim and Asian trios from the PGP and
uploaded the data to:
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/technical/complete_data/trios

In addition, NIST has been doing 150x150bp HiSeq sequencing and performed
preliminary analyses of 2 ~50x runs from each member of the Ashkenazim trio
using the BWA-GATK pipeline on Basespace.  BAM and VCF files have been
uploaded to:
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/technical/NISTAshkenazimTrio

Additional datasets will be added to the ftp as they are uploaded over the
coming months, and NIST plans to integrate the data to form high-confidence
calls in the future.

There are also some updates for NA12878, which NIST plans to release as a
Reference Material around the end of 2014.  We have created a new "release"
folder, which simplifies finding the most recent high-confidence calls for
each genome.  For NA12878, the most recent calls and bed file will always be
at:
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/NA12878_HG001/latest

We have also uploaded fastq files from ~300x total coverage of 150x150bp
HiSeq2500 sequencing of NA12878/HG001 to:
ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/technical/NIST_NA12878_HG001_HiSeq_300x

In the near future, we plan to restructure the data directory soon to make it
easier to navigate and find accessioned data from all of the candidate NIST
Reference Materials part of GIAB.

Cheers,

Justin
