We've developed a draft agenda for the upcoming GIAB workshop on January 29-30, 2015 at Stanford University.  You can find it on google docs here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FcE59_MTFdSq8-ch9Tm2UO_dDtRvwz6yl6hdrtZYpu4/edit?usp=sharing
 
We may update this agenda in the next week as we finalize speakers and topics for discussion, and we welcome any suggestions.
