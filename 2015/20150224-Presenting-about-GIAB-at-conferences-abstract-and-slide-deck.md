Presenting about GIAB at conferences, abstract, and slide deck

Post date: Tuesday, February 24, 2015 - 11:44 

<sub>At the steering committee meeting, we decided that it would be useful for others in addition to Marc and me to present about GIAB at conferences since we cannot go to every conference.  To facilitate this, we are making a general abstract and slide deck available for anyone to use, as well as a schedule of upcoming conferences to which anyone can add.  If you're interested in submitting an abstract and/or presenting about GIAB at a conference, you can add it to the spreadsheet schedule of conferences and send me an email. Also, if we are missing any potentially important conferences on the spreadsheet, please add new lines for them. 
 
Here are the links:
Abstract (if you'd like to make substantive changes, it would be best to copy it and put it on a new page so people have multiple options): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TzfTBCp-1aiLhSM2MlvTeFNpZTmRoquI6_Q0ad8dXrE/edit?usp=sharing
Slide deck (pptx can be downloaded): http://www.slideshare.net/GenomeInABottle/150224-giab-30-min-generic-slides 
Schedule of conferences: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-VPmlejDHQSH1ifFGX_rUsRt1G9DZV9JeQ2eQB4M4b8/edit?usp=sharing
 
We've also uploaded posters that Marc and I are presenting at AGBT this week - we're looking forward to seeing many of you there!
