GIAB PGP Trio data on FTP site

Post date: Monday, February 2, 2015 - 09:36 

<sub>Hi all,

Thank you for the great workshop last week.  As we discussed at the workshop, several datasets for the GIAB PGP Trios are now on the FTP site:

PacBio data (~20x on Ashkenazim son and ~7x on each parent): ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/technical/pacbio_data/HG002_HG003_HG004

Illumina HiSeq (~300x paired end on each member of Ashkenazim trio): ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/technical/NISTAshkenazimTrio

Complete Genomics (~100x per family member): ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/technical/complete_data/trios

Ion exome sequencing (~1000x - under the ion_exome folder for each family member): ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio

 

All of this data is made public for analysis without restrictions, though we plan to write a Scientific Data paper in the next couple months that should be cited.

In the coming weeks, additional datasets are likely to be added, including additional PacBio, BioNano, Illumina mate-pair, Complete Genomics LFR, and custom moleculo sequencing.

Cheers,

Justin
