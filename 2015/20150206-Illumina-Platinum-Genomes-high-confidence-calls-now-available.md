Illumina Platinum Genomes high-confidence calls now available

Post date: Friday, February 6, 2015 - 10:32 

We would like to inform you that, as part of the Platinum Genomes project, Illumina now offers a carefully curated set of phased variant calls for NA12877 and NA12878.

The Platinum Genomes project started with the goal of creating a high confidence set of variant calls. The whole Coriell CEPH family #1463 was sequenced to 50x depth on HiSeq systems with a PCR-free sample preparation protocol. A large set of candidate variants was obtained from multiple variant calling methods and a set of high-confidence calls was derived, by taking into account the inheritance constraints in the family and the concordance of variant calls across different methods. The full set of Platinum Genomes public data, including raw base calls, VCF files with high confidence variant calls and documentation, are freely available at http://www.illumina.com/platinumgenomes/. The VCF files have been also copied to the GiaB ftp site: ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/giab/ftp/technical/platinum_genomes/IlluminaPlatinumGenomes_v7.0/. Please cite the Platinum Genomes website and Illumina, Inc. in publications and other public usage of these data.

On a related note, Illumina has also upgraded the Variant Calling Assessment Tool (VCAT) BaseSpace app: https://basespace.illumina.com/apps/1126125/VCAT-v2-0. VCAT provides a simple user interface for assessing the accuracy of SNV and Indel calling in terms of precision and recall, based on Platinum Genomes and/or GiaB high confidence call sets. The functionality of VCAT is primarily based on vcftools, a widely used open source toolkit.
