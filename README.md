<sub>The Genome in a Bottle Consortium is holding its 7th open, public workshop at the Li Ka Sheng Center on the Stanford University campus January 28-29, 2016.  GIAB is developing reference materials, reference data, and methods to use the materials and data to assess performance of human genome sequencing.  At this workshop, we will discuss progress developing high-confidence variant calls of all sizes for NIST whole genome Reference Materials.  We will also discuss the roadmap for future work of GIAB, including analysis of structural variants and difficult regions of the genome and other potential genomic Reference Materials. The workshop is planned for 9am to 5:30pm on Jan 28 and 9am to 1pm on Jan 29, followed by a steering committee meeting from 1-3pm.</sub>
