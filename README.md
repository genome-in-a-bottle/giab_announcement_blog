<b>Preprint describing GIAB PGP data now on biorxiv</b></sub><br />
<sub>Post date: Wednesday, September 16, 2015 - 06:37</sub>

<sub>Our manuscript describing GIAB data from the GIAB PGP trios and NA12878 is now available as a preprint at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/15/026468.  Thank you to all of you who contributed to these data!  The manuscript is submitted to Nature Scientific Data as well.  Note that this is a "Data Descriptor" that describes the data and QC analyses, but not the downstream analyses we are currently doing to generate candidate variant calls and form high-confidence calls.</sub>

<sub>We are thrilled to announce that the pilot GIAB/NIST Reference Material 8398, Human DNA for Whole-Genome Variant Assessment (Daughter of Utah/European Ancestry) is released! This is genomic DNA from a large batch of the same cell line as NA12878.  It is available for sale from the NIST Standard Reference Material website at http://tinyurl.com/giabpilot.</sub>
