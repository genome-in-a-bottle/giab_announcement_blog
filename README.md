<sub>Our manuscript describing GIAB data from the GIAB PGP trios and NA12878 is now available as a preprint at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/15/026468.  Thank you to all of you who contributed to these data!  The manuscript is submitted to Nature Scientific Data as well.  Note that this is a "Data Descriptor" that describes the data and QC analyses, but not the downstream analyses we are currently doing to generate candidate variant calls and form high-confidence calls. We welcome any suggestions for the manuscript while it is in the review process. If you submit any publications using these GIAB data, we ask that you cite the preprint until the manuscript is published</sub>
